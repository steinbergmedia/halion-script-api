# FlexPhraser

## Description

The FlexPhaser template is a special template that allows to control HALion's FlexPhraser. It combines several controls which are preconfigured within the template and partially use dedicated internal parameters which are not supposed to change. This also guarantees that the template supports the usage of HALion's FlexPhraser variations. If engine parameters like Swing, Gate Scale, Vel Scale, etc. are connected directly to controls outside the template, they only control the first variation. To understand the functionality and options, add the template to your macro page and enter edit mode on it. This way, you can see the structure of the template.

>&#10069; To see an example how to use the template, load the Basic Controls macro page and check the FlexPhraser example page. Here, you can see how the various parameters are connected and how the template is combined with the FlexPhraserStepSeq template, which allows to edit user phrases.

## Properties

|Poperty|Description|
|:-|:-|
|**Name**|The name of the FlexPhraser.|
{{#include ./_Position-Size.md}}
{{#include ./_Attach.md}}
{{#include ./_Tooltip.md}}
|**Template**|The referenced template.|
|**Scope**|Defines the path to the FlexPhraser that is controlled.|
|**Product**|Set this to "HALion" if you want to load HALion factory and user StepSEQ phrases from the standard HALion path. **Load From** must be set to "StepSEQ Phrases". When saving user phrases, these will be written to /User/documents/Steinberg/HALion/Subpresets/StepSEQ Phrases/.<p>You can also specify the name for your own product. When preparing factory StepSEQ Phrases as part of a VST Sound container, StepSEQ Phrases must be located in the corresponding folder /"Product"/Sub Presets/StepSEQ Phrases/. In that case only StepSEQ Phrases located in the "Product" subfolder are shown in the phrase selector. When saving user phrases, these will be written into /User/documents/Steinberg/"Product"/Sub Presets/StepSEQ Phrases/</p><p>You can also include both the "HALion" folder and the folder of your product, by setting Product to "Product|HALion". The selector will then show the content of both locations. Saving a phrase will use the first "Product" folder.</p>|
|**Load From**|Here you can specify a sub path to define a folder (or path) inside your product folder. When delivering VST Sound containers that contain StepSEQ Phrases, these must be located in the corresponding path to be found. To see HALion factory phrases, you must select "StepSEQ Phrases".<p>**Example:** Load From = "StepSEQ Phrases" in combination with product = "MyProduct", will load presets from /MyProduct/Sub Presets/StepSEQ Phrases</p>|
|**Save To**|Allows you to specify a sub path relative to the Load From path, to define in which folder presets are saved by default.<p>**Example:** Save To = "MySEQ" in combination with Load From = "StepSEQ Phrases" and with product = "MyProduct", will save presets to /MyProduct/Sub Presets/StepSEQ Phrases/MySEQ</p>|

Furthermore, there are controls for Arp Mode, Key Replace, Arp Wrap and Arp Quantize.</li><ul><li>**Select:** A switch with a "Value" set to "@PhraseSelectPopup", to select phrases. If you deliver a VST Sound container with phrases, they must be located in a folder /Steinberg/HALion/Subpresets/StepSEQPhrases or a subfolder if "Product" is set.</li><li>**Name:** A text control with a "Value" set to "@UsrArp", to display the name of the current user phrase.</li><li>**Save:** A switch with a "Value" set to "@SubPresetSave", to save phrases.

Its "Value" must be set to "@EnableGrooveQuantize".</li><li>**Internal:** this is required to provide the drop functionality and a context menu to clear the the quantize data buffer. Its "View" parameter must be set to "@dropzone_midifile".</li></ul></ul>|
