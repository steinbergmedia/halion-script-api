# Modulation Matrix for Synth Zones

This how-to provides a modulation matrix for Synth zones that you can use as a basis when creating a modulation matrix for an instrument. There are no modulation source or destination controls on the macro page, only the modulation matrix with its controls, and the UI and MIDI scripts. The main focus is on the selection of modulation destinations, which have been selected with regard to their usability in combination with Synth zones.

For a modulation matrix that matches a different zone type, see [Modulation Matrix for FM Zones](./Modulation-Matrix-for-FM-Zones.md), [Modulation Matrix for Grain Zones](./Modulation-Matrix-for-Grain-Zones.md), [Modulation Matrix for Sample Zones](./Modulation-Matrix-for-Sample-Zones.md), [Modulation Matrix for Spectral Zones](./Modulation-Matrix-for-Spectral-Zones.md), and [Modulation Matrix for Wavetable Zones](./Modulation-Matrix-for-Wavetable-Zones.md).

## How the Elements Interact

The modulation matrix is provided as-is, without detailed explanations. For information on how this modulation matrix works, see [Creating a Modulation Matrix](./Creating-a-Modulation-Matrix.md).
