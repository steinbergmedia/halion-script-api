|**undo**|Determines if the parameter change will be part of the undo. This argument is only evaluated in the controller context. A parameter change in the processor context never has undo. If setParameter is called in the controller context it will be part of the undo, unless you set this argument to ``false``. For example, you should set this to ``false`` if the call to setParameter is made within a parameter callback that is already part of the undo, and if the order of execution of these parameter changes is important.|boolean, optional|
