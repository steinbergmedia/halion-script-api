# getQCAssignmentBypass

>**getQCAssignmentBypass(qc, assignment)**

## Description

Function to retrieve the bypass state of the specified quick control assignment. The quick control assignment is determined by the [Layer](./Layer.md) object, the index of the quick control and the index of the assignment itself. For example, ``this.parent`` defines the parent layer of the script module as the layer that contains the quick control. The ``qc`` argument is the index of the quick control and the ``assignment`` argument is the index of the assignment with the requested bypass state. The indices of the quick controls and the assignments both start counting from 1.

**Available in:** Controller.

## Arguments

|Argument|Description|Value Type|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**qc**|The index of the quick control.|number|
|**assignment**|The index of the quick control assignment.|number|

## Return Values

Returns the bypass state of the specified quick control assignment as boolean value.

## Example

```lua
-- Print the bypass state of the qc assignment.

layer = this.parent
qc = 1
assignment = 1
   
qcBypass = layer:getQCAssignmentBypass(qc, assignment)
    
print("Bypass of '"..layer.name.."', QC "..qc..", assignment "..assignment..": "..tostring(qcBypass)..".")
```
