>&#10069; An [Element](./Element.md) object can only have one parent. It cannot be child of multiple parents. Therefore, an [Element](./Element.md) object that you retrieved from the running plug-in instance must be removed before it can be inserted again. The [Element](./Element.md) objects that you retrieve through [loadPreset](./loadPreset.md) or [loadPresetAsync](./loadPresetAsync.md) can be inserted freely, because these functions create a copy of the [Element](./Element.md) objects when reading them.
